TODO(jjo):  [2012/Sep/27]
* [P0]  Support setting an invalid volume-map  - ie don't
        assume we've 'lost' our volume assignment -> raise error,
        to require human intervention (play safe & conservative)

* [P0]  Review state/needed configs/etc in case of "re-attaching" set
        of volumes into a fresh new deployment (should serve data
        present in volume-s) - this really requires a well thought
        statemachine transition diagram, to assure we'll never e.g.:
        - override already populated volumes, and/or "partially"
          serve a cluster (units should behave consistently).
     
* [P0]  Fix/implement DELAY_START_UNTIL_VOLUME logic (config set
        to indeed make the instance to void serving, until volume-map
        "assigns" a volume to it)

* [P0]  Do "full-cycle" testing, specially assess that volumes
        survive destroy-service, and can 'resume' serving if
        re-attached and setup with proper 'volume-map'.

* [P1]  Create helper scripts to scrape euca-describe-volumes, and 'merge'
        with juju status output, to:
        - fire attachments, then:
        - set a proper volume-map (instance->volume)
